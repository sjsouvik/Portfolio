        There are so many subjects to learn in
        <i>Computer Science Engineering</i> like in other branches of
        Engineering which seems overwhelming and students learn, complete
        semester exams and move on to the next semester where they get new set
        of subjects to complete.
      </p>

      <p class="blog-para">
        On the way to this long journey, if they don't get proper guidance they
        just read, learn and get new subjects in new semester where they forget
        about topics and subjects they learnt in previous semesters. However,
        there're few subjects or learnings that we must know to become a good
        engineer. So, here are few advices :

          <h3>Programming :</h3>
          <p class="blog-para">
            As a Computer Science Engineering student, we should learn first how
            to write a program? so learn that and practice with your preferred
            programming language. As a part of the syllabus, first we get to
            learn C, so learn that and try to learn a object oriented
            programming language after that which will help you to understand
            <strong>OOP</strong> concepts with some other benefits - like
            <i>library and framework</i>. These libraries will help you to learn
            and use already implemented data structures. Once you know basic
            programming, start learning about
            <i>data structures and algorithms</i> which will help you to be a
            better programmer.

          <h3>Projects :</h3>
          <p class="blog-para">
            Projects are really important to showcase that you know how to do
            development work which you will be doing in your entire career. So,
            for that you can start with basics of web development, build small
            small projects and whatever projects you build, keep the source code
            of those in <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>. I would
            recommend to take some good courses from
            <a href="https://udemy.com">Udemy</a> on front end and back end
            technologies which will improve your development skills, also you
            can build your own ideas by using those learnings.

          <h3>Core Subjects :</h3>
          <p class="blog-para">
            There are few core subjects that we need to know to prepare for
            interviews as well as to become a good enginner, subjects are
            <i>Operating System, DBMS, Computer Networks</i>. You can think that
            questions related to these subjects might be asked in any interview
            throughout the career. If you are done these 3 subjects then you can
            learn <i>Compiler Design, Computer Architecture, Automata...</i>
